## Unreleased

* Migrate saved unsent events from old localStorage keys and meta data in cookies to new scoped keys.

### 3.0.1 (June 22, 2016)

* Update README with link to our [Google Tag Manager integration demo app](https://github.com/amplitude/GTM-Web-Demo).
* Fix bug where referrer and UTM params were being captured more than once per session.

### 3.0.0 (May 27, 2016)

* Add support for logging events to multiple Amplitude apps. **Note this is a major update, and may break backwards compatability.** See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Javascript#300-update-and-logging-events-to-multiple-amplitude-apps) for details.
* Init callback now passes the Amplitude instance as an argument to the callback function.

### 2.13.0 (May 26, 2016)

* Update our fork of [UAParser.js](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js) from v0.7.7 to v0.7.10. This will improve the resolution of user agent strings to device and OS information.

### 2.12.1 (April 21, 2016)

* Silence console warnings for various UTM property keys with undefined values.

### 2.12.0 (April 20, 2016)

* Add support for setting groups for users and events. See the [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Javascript#setting-groups) for more information.
* Add `logRevenueV2` and new `Revenue` class to support logging revenue events with properties, and revenue type. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Javascript#tracking-revenue) for more info.
* Add helper method to regenerate a new random deviceId. This can be used to anonymize a user after they log out. Note this is not recommended unless you know what are you doing. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Javascript#logging-out-and-anonymous-users) for more information.

### 2.11.0 (April 14, 2016)

* Add tracking of each user's initial_utm parameters (which is captured as a set once operation). Utm parameters are now sent only once per user session.
* Add documentation for SDK functions. You can take a look [here](https://rawgit.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Javascript/master/documentation/Amplitude.html). A link has also been added to the Readme.
* Fix cookie test bug. In rare cases, the cookie test failed to delete the key used in testing. Reloading the page generated new keys, filling up the cookie over time. Fixed test to re-use the same key.

### 2.10.0 (March 30, 2016)

* Identify function now accepts a callback function as an argument. The callback will be run after the identify event is sent.
* Add support for `prepend` user property operation. This allows you to insert value(s) at the front of a list. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Javascript#user-properties-and-user-property-operations) for more details.
* Keep sessions and event metadata in-sync across multiple windows/tabs.
